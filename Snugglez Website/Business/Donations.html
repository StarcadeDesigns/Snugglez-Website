<h1 style= "color:white;"> Donations </h1>

<p1 style= "color:white;">While I don't ask donations because frankly I love streaming and making content I alway appreciate a donation as it helps with little things like buying games that you guys request that I don't already own, buying new and better equipment so that we can improve the stream and so on. Bottom line is donations are appreciated not necessary.</p1>
